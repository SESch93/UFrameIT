## Project Configuration
- 1. Get Unity 2019.4.x (LTS). We update this to the newest LTS version periodically, but any 2019.4 version should work, you can ignore the version warning.
- 2. Clone this repository
- 3. Get the [FrameIT archives](https://github.com/UFrameIT/archives), make sure to update the submodules with this [script](https://gist.github.com/ComFreek/dcadfec0214d87e9ad3268e61479d05b)
- 4. Install [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/idea/)
- 5. Clone and [install](https://github.com/UniFormal/MMT/blob/devel/src/frameit-mmt/installation.md) the [Server Component](https://github.com/UniFormal/MMT/tree/devel/src/frameit-mmt)
- 6. Congratulations! You have all components. Just make sure to run the server first via IntelliJ if you want to run the game inside Unity.
