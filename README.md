# UFrameIT

The FrameIT project builds a Framework for developing Serious Games by combining Virtual Worlds with Mathematical Knowledge Management. 
The UFrameIT framework uses the Unity game engine with the [MMT](https://uniformal.github.io/) system.
This repository contains the Unity project, which currently includes the framework itself and a demo game.
